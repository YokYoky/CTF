It takes a team to do security right, so we have layered our defenses!

Download the attached file.

First, i check what kind of file is the layered_security with file command. It outputs the file is a GIMP file, so i open it with gimp.

Inside there is multiple layer, i just remove the layer one by one by clicking the eye thing, until the flag show up.
