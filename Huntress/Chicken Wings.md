I ordered chicken wings at the local restaurant, but uh... this really isn't what I was expecting...

Download the attached file.

The file is a utf-8 text file, I used cat command to print out the contents of the file.

It outputs some weird chicken emoji
```console
$ cat chicken_wings

```
I google the output, the output must be a encoded wingdings.
