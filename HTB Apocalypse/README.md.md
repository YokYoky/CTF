My journey in HackTheBox **Cyber Apocalypse CTF 2025** is fun and challenging, I gain some new knowledge and realization. I only managed to solved **very easy** - **medium** challenges from various categories. I also tackle some challenges but got stuck due to lack of knowledge and not thinking critically. This indicates my current knowledge and areas I need to improve to become a better hacker.
