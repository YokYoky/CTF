# Challenge
Elowen Moonsong, an Elven mage of great wisdom, has discovered an ancient scroll rumored to contain the location of The Dragonâ€™s Heart. However, the scroll is enchanted with an old magical cipher, preventing Elowen from reading it.

The challenge give us a executable file, lets open this in ghidra to analyze the file.

In decrypt_message function, we can see how the file works. 
```
void decrypt_message(char *param_1)

{
  int iVar1;
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  int local_3c;
  undefined8 local_38;
  undefined4 local_30;
  undefined4 uStack_2c;
  undefined4 uStack_28;
  undefined8 local_24;
  long local_10;
  
  local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  local_38 = 0x716e32747c435549;
  local_30 = 0x6760346d;
  uStack_2c = 0x6068356d;
  uStack_28 = 0x75327335;
  local_24 = 0x7e643275346e69;
  for (local_3c = 0; *(char *)((long)&local_38 + (long)local_3c) != '\0'; local_3c = local_3c + 1) {
    *(char *)((long)&local_38 + (long)local_3c) = *(char *)((long)&local_38 + (long)local_3c) + -1;
  }
  iVar1 = strcmp(param_1,(char *)&local_38);
  if (iVar1 == 0) {
    puts("The Dragon\'s Heart is hidden beneath the Eternal Flame in Eldoria.");
  }
  else {
    puts("The scroll remains unreadable... Try again.");
  }
  if (local_10 != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return;
}
```

```
local_38 = 0x716e32747c435549;
local_30 = 0x6760346d;
uStack_2c = 0x6068356d;
uStack_28 = 0x75327335;
local_24 = 0x7e643275346e69;
```
These variables contain the encrypted password.

```
for (local_3c = 0; *(char *)((long)&local_38 + (long)local_3c) != '\0'; local_3c = local_3c + 1) {
    *(char *)((long)&local_38 + (long)local_3c) = *(char *)((long)&local_38 + (long)local_3c) + -1;
}
```
The function decrements each byte of the stored password by `1` to get the correct password.

```python
import struct

# Encrypted hex values stored in memory
encrypted_hex = [
    0x716e32747c435549,
    0x6760346d,
    0x6068356d,
    0x75327335,
    0x7e643275346e69
]

# Convert to bytes and decrypt by subtracting 1 from each byte
decrypted_bytes = b''.join(
    struct.pack("<Q", value)[:8] if isinstance(value, int) and value >= 0x100000000 else struct.pack("<I", value)[:4]
    for value in encrypted_hex
)

# Reverse the +1 encryption by subtracting 1 from each byte safely
decrypted_bytes = bytes((b - 1) % 256 for b in decrypted_bytes)

# Convert to string
decrypted_flag = decrypted_bytes.decode(errors="ignore")
print(decrypted_flag)
```

```python
HTB{s1mpl3_fl4g_4r1thm3t1c}
```


### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Imports:**
``` python
import struct
```
- We import the `struct` module, which helps with packing and unpacking data into binary formats (like integers or floats) in Python. It allows us to convert numbers into byte representations.

2. Encrypted Hex Values:
```python
encrypted_hex = [
    0x716e32747c435549,
    0x6760346d,
    0x6068356d,
    0x75327335,
    0x7e643275346e69
]
```
- This list `encrypted_hex` contains the encrypted values in hexadecimal form.
    
- Each hexadecimal value represents an encoded byte sequence. The task is to decrypt these values to retrieve the original flag.

3. Converting Hex to Bytes:
``` python
decrypted_bytes = b''.join(
    struct.pack("<Q", value)[:8] if isinstance(value, int) and value >= 0x100000000 else struct.pack("<I", value)[:4]
    for value in encrypted_hex
)
```
- **`struct.pack("<Q", value)`**: The `struct.pack()` function converts an integer (`value`) into a binary representation.
    
    - **`<Q`**: The `<` character tells the pack function to use little-endian byte order. The `Q` character stands for an unsigned long long (8 bytes, 64 bits) integer.
        
- **`struct.pack("<I", value)`**: Similarly, the `<I` format is for packing a 4-byte (32-bit) unsigned integer.
    
- **`[:8]`** and **`[:4]`**: These slices ensure that we extract only the first 8 bytes (64-bit) for larger integers or 4 bytes (32-bit) for smaller integers from the packed values.
    
- **`.join(...)`**: This joins the byte sequences into one continuous byte string, which represents the encrypted flag.
    

In essence, this part of the code is transforming the 64-bit and 32-bit integer values from `encrypted_hex` into byte sequences. The decision of whether to use 4 or 8 bytes is based on the size of the integer.

4. Decrypting the Encrypted Bytes:
```python
decrypted_bytes = bytes((b - 1) % 256 for b in decrypted_bytes)
```
- **`(b - 1) % 256`**: Here, we decrypt the bytes by reversing the encryption step, which was assumed to have incremented each byte by 1.
    
    - Subtracting `1` undoes that step, but it might cause a byte to go below `0`. The `% 256` ensures that the byte wraps around correctly (i.e., it will always stay within the range of `0` to `255`).
        
    - This effectively undoes the transformation of each byte and restores the original values.
        
- **`bytes(...)`**: The result is converted back to a bytes object, which contains the decrypted flag.

5. Converting Bytes to String:
```python
decrypted_flag = decrypted_bytes.decode(errors="ignore")
```
- **`decode()`**: The `decode()` function converts the byte sequence back into a string.
    
- **`errors="ignore"`**: This argument tells Python to ignore any errors that occur if there are invalid byte sequences during the conversion. It's a safety measure to avoid breaking the program in case the bytes don't perfectly correspond to valid characters.
