their are two ways to find the flag, wireshark or using string
In wireshark, open wireshark, click open a capture a file then select the pcap file
use http filter, examine the capture packet to find some possible key to flag
we found GET /?msg=(based64) we know this is base64 because of / =
now decode it to string to get the flag
flag{AFlagInPCAP}

2nd method use string
strings flag\ \(4\) | grep -i "GET /"
find the get /?msg=(base64)

my first try is use the wireshark and use http filter after that i have no idea what to do next.
I actually have no idea how i got the flag. with the help of some clue in comment section in ctflearn
